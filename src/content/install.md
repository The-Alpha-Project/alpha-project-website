# How to install and run Alpha Core 0.5.3 server

Here is a list of useful links to get you started:

* Old client ISOs [can be downloaded from Archive.org](https://archive.org/download/World_of_Warcraft_Client_and_Installation_Archive/ISO/)
* Modded executable (removes debug stuff, adds 16:9 support and normal login screen, etc): [can be found on Mediafire here.](https://www.mediafire.com/file/wjbk1ovyyb6ry7l/Mods.zip/file)
