**Q:** Are there any online servers?

**A:** Yes, we have a 0.5.3 server and a 1.12 one.


**Q:** How can I play the 0.5.3 server?

**A:** At this moment only Contributors (people who contribute in any way to the development of the emulator) and Supporters (people who donate to the project or provide any needed things like infrastructure or advertisement) can play it.
However, the emulator is completely available for you to download and set up your own server, if you are confident with Github you can find the links at the top of this page and the instructions in their readmes, for extra info click on [How to install](/install) on the menu.


**Q:** How can I play the 1.12 server?

**A:** For the time being the only way to register is to connect to our Discord server and send a PM to `@Alpha Project [Kalidar 1.12]` with the following text: `!register`. The realmlist is `logon1.thealphaproject.eu`. Please, use the Discord channels under the **KALIDAR** section for discussions about this server.
